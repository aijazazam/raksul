# Code Review Challenge

An intern created the program found in `main.go` and is asking you to review their code.

1. Start by figuring out what the program does.

1. Review their code. Provide specific suggestions and feedback to help your teammate to
   improve their coding style and address any issues with their implementation.

1. Refactor / rewrite their code in the way _you_ believe it should be implemented.

1. **NOTE: Keep your implementation as concise as possible!** Our own reference solution covers everything well and is only _~110 LOC_.

   Make sure to keep your implementation below _150 LOC_ including decent formatting and spacing _but not counting comments_.

# How to submit your code

1. Submit your code and review comments as a **secret Github gist**.

1. **Do NOT** leave comments or questions in this gist.

1. **Do NOT** fork this gist.

1. Send a link to your **secret gist** to ***********@raksul.com**
